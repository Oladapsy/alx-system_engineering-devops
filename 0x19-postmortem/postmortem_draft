i will be using web-debugging#1 for this project

duration of the outage:
	 this was a task in alx:
	 so i started 11:45am and was fixed at 12:45pm West African Time
	 
	 the site was not listening at port 80:
	 and all users were affected

	 the cause was that the site settings because its an nginx server the site-available settings was not linked to site-enabled default settings so the configuartion was ok but the configuration was not enabled making users not able to get to the site...

Timeline:

The issue was detected i will say by alx coz i was given the task to do...
but since we are using my instances i will say when alx tried to visit the website so they escalated it to me....

the issue was deteced via alx monitoring alert...

they reached out to me to fix it ...

misleading investigation: i tot there were errors in the configuration and checked through and took a while before i checked which service was listerning to port 80 before later checking the site enabled and figured its not there...

i checked the site enabled and saw it wasnt enabled so i did and test and it worked, so that is how i resolved it...


Root causes:
i think i have said that

so i wrote a script that should be executed after each configuartion to ensure it dosent repeat

#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Nginx likes port 80

cat /etc/nginx/sites-available/default > /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sudo service nginx restart
correction:
