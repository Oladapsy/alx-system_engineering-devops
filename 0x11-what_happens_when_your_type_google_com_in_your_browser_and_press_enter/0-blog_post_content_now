Hello everyone! Today, I'll be answering the question: What happens when you type (link unavailable) in your browser and press Enter?
To answer this, we need to explore the following key steps:
DNS request
TCP/IP
Firewall
HTTPS/SSL
Load balancer
Web server
Application server
Database
Introduction:
The journey of a URL when typed into the browser, for example, (link unavailable) and pressing Enter, is not a straightforward process. Multiple system technologies work together to deliver the information we request.
Preliminary step:
The browser first determines the protocol to use for communication. Since we specified HTTPS, the browser uses the secured SSL version of the HTTP protocol. If we didn't specify, the browser would default to HTTP.
Step 1: DNS Request
When you type (link unavailable) into your browser, the first step is to resolve the domain name to an IP address. Computers communicate via IP addresses, and the browser needs to find the server's IP address. The DNS record, like a ledger, maps domain names to IP addresses. The browser follows these steps:
a. Checks the local DNS cache for previous visits to retrieve the IP address.
b. Consults the operating system's DNS resolver, which may check the /etc/hosts file.
c. If both fail, the browser checks the internet provider's DNS servers, starting from the root domain to the top-level domain.
Step 2: TCP/IP
Once the IP address is resolved, the browser establishes a connection with the server using the TCP/IP protocol. TCP ensures reliable and ordered data delivery, while IP routes data packets between networks.
Step 3: Firewall
As the request passes through the internet, it may encounter firewalls that block or allow traffic based on predetermined security rules. Firewalls can be configured to perform various actions, including NAT, packet filtering, and stateful inspection.
Step 4: HTTPS/SSL
Since the URL starts with HTTPS, the connection is encrypted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security). This ensures confidential and tamper-proof data exchange between the browser and server.
Step 5: Load Balancer
Google has multiple servers to handle the high volume of requests. A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across servers to prevent overload. It receives requests, then distributes them to available servers based on configured algorithms and policies.
Step 6: Web Server
The request is received by a web server, which processes the request and returns an HTML document. This document may reference additional resources like CSS and JavaScript files.
Step 7: Application Server
The web server may communicate with an application server, which handles business logic and data processing. In Google's case, the application server retrieves data from the database, performs necessary calculations, and returns results to the web server.
Step 8: Database
The application server retrieves data from a database, which stores a wide range of information, including user data, application data, and more.
Conclusion:
When you type (link unavailable) and press Enter, your browser initiates a complex process involving DNS resolution, TCP/IP connection establishment, firewall traversal, HTTPS encryption, load balancing, web server processing, application server logic, and database retrieval. This journey highlights the many systems and technologies working together to deliver websites and applications.
