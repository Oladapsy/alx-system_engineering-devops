The Journey of a URL: What Happens When You Type and Press Enter
Introduction:
When you type into your browser and press Enter, a complex process unfolds, involving multiple systems and technologies working together to deliver the website. Let's dive into the journey of a URL and explore what happens under the hood.
Preliminary Step:
The browser first determines the protocol to use for communication. Since we specified https, the browser will use the secured version of the HTTP protocol. If no protocol is specified, the browser will default to HTTP.
Step 1: DNS Request
When you type , the first step is to resolve the domain name to an IP address. Computers communicate via IP addresses, and the browser needs to know the IP address of the server hosting Google's website. The browser follows these steps to resolve the domain name:
Checks the browser's cache for previous visits to the site
Checks the operating system's /etc/hosts file for the IP address
If both fail, the browser queries DNS servers, starting from the root domain and moving to the top-level domain
Fun Activity: Type ping www.google.com in your Linux terminal to see the IP address resolved.
Step 2: TCP/IP
Once the IP address is resolved, the browser establishes a connection with the server using the TCP/IP protocol. TCP ensures reliable and ordered data delivery, while IP routes data packets between networks.
Step 3: Firewall
As the request passes through the internet, it may encounter firewalls that block or allow traffic based on predetermined security rules. Firewalls protect against unwanted IP addresses and can be configured to allow or deny access to specific IP addresses, ports, or protocols.
Step 4: HTTPS/SSL
Since the URL starts with https, the connection is encrypted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security). This ensures that data exchanged between the browser and server remains confidential and tamper-proof. SSL uses algorithms like RSA to generate public and private keys for encryption and decryption.
Step 5: Load Balancer
To handle a large volume of requests, Google uses multiple servers and a load balancer. The load balancer accepts requests at its frontend and directs them to available servers at its backend, ensuring efficient distribution of traffic.
Step 6: Web Server
The request is received by a web server, which processes the request and returns the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up the Google homepage.
Step 7: Application Server
The web server may communicate with an application server, which handles business logic and data processing. In Google's case, the application server retrieves data from the database and performs necessary calculations before returning results to the web server.
Step 8: Database
The application server retrieves data from a database, which stores information such as search results, user preferences, and advertising content.
Conclusion:
When you type and press Enter, your browser initiates a complex process involving DNS resolution, TCP/IP connection establishment, firewall traversal, HTTPS encryption, load balancing, web server processing, application server logic, and database retrieval. This journey highlights the many systems and technologies that work together to deliver the websites and applications we use every day.
